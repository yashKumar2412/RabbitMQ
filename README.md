# RabbitMQ
As part of my Enterprise Distributed Systems course, I implemented a simple producer and consumer application to run a simple messaging application using RabbitMQ.

There are two use cases derived with these two applications:
1. Run both applications together to observe live production and consumption of a million messages. The report for this can be found in the Message Queues Assignment file.
2. Run producer first to load up the queue with a million messages, then bring up the consumer after some time to consume from the queue to display the asynchronous nature of messaging queues such as RabbitMQ. The report for this can be found in the Asynchronous Message Queues Assignment file.
